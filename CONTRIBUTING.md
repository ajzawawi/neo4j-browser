## What should I know before I get started?

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.


## How Can I Contribute?

## General Workflow
1. Fork the repo
1. Cut a namespaced feature branch from master
1. Make commits to your feature branch. Commit messages should follow the following convention:
  - Add a [name of feature]
  - Edit a [namem of file]
  - Fix [name of bug]
  - Edit/Fix style [for formatting, typos, etc with no code change]
  - Refactor [details about refactored feature or code]
  - Add test [name of spec]
1. When you've finished with your fix or feature, push changes into your branch. submit a [pull request][]
   directly to master. Include a detailed description of your changes.
1. Your pull request will be reviewed by another maintainer. The point of code
   reviews is to help keep the codebase clean and of high quality and, equally
   as important, to help you grow as a programmer. If your code reviewer
   requests you make a change you don't understand, ask them why.
1. Fix any issues raised by your code reviewer, and push your fixes as a single
   new commit.
1. Once the pull request has been reviewed, it will be merged by another member of the team. Do not merge your own commits.

### Reporting Bugs
You can report a bug by submitting a new issue. Before you submit a bug report, you should search existing issues. Be sure to check both currently open issues, as well as issues that are already closed. If you find an issue that seems to be similar to yours, read through it.

If you can't find anything in the existing issues, file a new issue.

You should be sure to include the version the project, as well as versions of related packages. For example, be sure to include the version numbers output by the commands node --version and npm list. If you notice that your installed version is not the latest, use npm update and confirm that the issue is still there.

Project maintainers really appreciate thorough explanations. It usually helps them address the problem more quickly, so everyone wins!

### Suggesting Enhancements
If you have any idea about how to enhance and improve the project and make it better, please create a pull request with your improvement.

### Your First Code Contribution
### Pull Requests
Make a clear pull request from your fork detailing exactly what changes you made and what feature this should add. The clearer your pull request is the faster you can get your changes incorporated into this repo.

## Styleguides
### Git Commit Messages
- Commit messages should be written in the present tense. e.g. "Add new file".
- The first line of your commit message should be a brief summary of what the
  commit changes. Aim for about 70 characters max. Remember: This is a summary,
  not a detailed description of everything that changed.
- If you want to explain the commit in more depth, following the first line should
  be a blank line and then a more detailed description of the commit. This can be
  as detailed as you want, so dig into details here and keep the first line short.
